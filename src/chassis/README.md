## Switch Cover Layers

If you want to use Frame1/Gamerfinger sized keycaps (20.64mm), use a ~9mm GFCover layer.

If you want to use normal square keycaps, use a ~6mm SquareCover layer.

If you want to use small circular (sometimes called typewriter style) keycaps, you can either use a ~9mm GFCover layer to have the ability to swap to those later, or a ~6mm GFCover layer with a ~3mm SmallCover layer on top.

## Switch Plate

Get a ~1.5mm SwitchPlate layer in aluminum/steel/brass.

## Wall Layers

If you are using a GCCMX switch PCB + Model S logic PCB, use a 9mm GCCMXCover, and a 12mm ModelSCover.

If you want to use any other internals, with a Neutrik form factor feedthrough, get a 24mm GenericWallLayer.

If you want to use some other feedthrough, you can modify the GenericWallLayer file's cutout and order whatever thickenss panel fits your needs.

## Bottom Layer

Get whatever thickness Bottom panel that would be sturdy. I have done 3mm acrylic layers, and I imagine 1.5mm metal layers would be fine too.

## Model S USBC Cover

If you are using a Model S and have access to a 3D printer, this STL can be printed to cover the USBC cutout.

## Recommended US Laser Cutters

https://sendcutsend.com/ - Excellent metal cutting prices, free and fast production/shipping. Also has other materials nowadays. ACM is a really interesting/cheap material.

https://www.ponoko.com/ - Tons of material options, solid pricing, good bulk discounts, but they take quite a while to arrive.

https://www.pololu.com/product/749 - Fewer options than Ponoko, but still quite a lot. Similar pricing to Ponoko, but no bulk AFAIK. Ships faster than Ponoko.
